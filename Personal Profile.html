      <h4 class = "questions">What do those tests mean for you?</h4>
      <p class = "info">What these tests has shown me are the characteristics of who I am as a person. My behaviour, my personality, my dreams etc. But the most meaningful information that the tests have provided for me are my strengths and weaknesses. The limits I have that I need to improve on in order to become a better version of myself, so that I am able to learn from my mistakes in hopes that those learnt mistakes can help me in the future and my goals. It has shown me that although having your strengths are important, but it is essential to work on your weaknesses to have a greater range of strengths I can use. </p>

            <h4 class = "questions">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
            <p class = "info">I believe these results can influence my behaviour in a team. I understand my own strengths and how I can help contribute in the most effective and efficient way for my team. But it is sometimes difficult to figure out my own weaknesses until I make a mistake. While in a team, I am afraid to make mistakes. If I end up making a mistake, I believe it may influence my behaviour negatively because I affected the team’s project. However, although I may affect my team's project, I need to understand that mistakes can happen from time to time and not everyone is perfect. In a way, learning from your failures lead to success.</p>

                  <h4 class = "questions">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
                  <p class = "info">To form a team, it’s good to have a nice balance in different areas where each person has greater strength in. I believe communication between team members is essential.  It’s important to discuss and establish the ideas, goals, and roles of the assignment and what each person can work on efficiently, so as a team we can properly understand which areas we lack skill in. This not only strengthens each other’s chemistry as a team but also allows everyone to understand their own roles, so they don’t go off track. </p>
