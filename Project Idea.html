      <h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>

      <h4 class = "questions"> Overview </h4>
      <p class = "info">The type of project idea I decided to innovate, is an indie game project, where the game will be developed using game tools such as Unity, Construct2 or Cocos2d. This game concept will consist themes of cute, yet horror genres. It will be a 2d action-based game, where you are able to play and unlock animal characters and abilities to fight horror-like demon villains that attempt to overrule the world with corruption. The mission is to simply defeat the enemies.</p>

      <h4 class = "questions"> Motivation </h4>
      <p class = "info"> My motivation for deciding to choose a game concept over the others, is due to my love for games. I have always played video games growing up, and developing a game is something that greatly excites me and my passion for IT. This project will be interesting for a variety of people who enjoy playing video games in general, as video games is a hobby enjoyed by young and old across the world with the estimate of 3.09 billion gamers. It will become useful for many people who play games for entertainment and their hobbies, which is something that I aim to achieve in this project.</p>

      <h4 class = "questions"> Description </h4>
      <h3 class = "sub"> <u>Design</u> </h3>
        <p class = "info"> This game is a consist genres of cute and horror. It is an action-based game where the goal is to defeat demon monsters in order to stop the corruption of the world. The design of the game would be a 2d pixel/sprite-based animation. Example of the game design would be similar to the game below:</p>
        <div class = "middle"> <img src= "./images/design.PNG" alt = "Design" height = "500px" width = "1000px"></div>
        <div class = "source"><a href = "https://graphicriver.net/item/2d-plane-shooter-game-asset/22882275)"> Source to the content</a></div>

        <br>

        <h3 class = "sub"> <u>Game Functions and Controls</u> </h3>
        <p class = "info"> When launching the game, you will be presented with the basic menu screen options to choose from such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><pre class = "list">
            -Start
            (Start Game)
             <img src= "./images/start.png" alt = "start" height = "200px" width = "400px"></pre></li>
            <li><pre class = "list">
              -Continue
              (Continuing the previous save)
               <img src= "./images/continue.png" alt = "continue" height = "200px" width = "500px"></pre></li>
              <li><pre class = "list">
                -Settings
                (Adjusting display resolution, controls, volume, and brightness)
                 <img src= "./images/settings.PNG" alt = "settings" height = "200px" width = "450px"></pre></li>
                <li><pre class = "list">
                  -Exit
                  (Exiting the game)
                   <img src= "./images/exit.png" alt = "exit" height = "300px" width = "400px"></pre></li> </ul>

              <p class = "info"> The objective of the game is to shoot down and defeat enemies to clear the stage. When starting the game, you will be given the option of selecting from a variety of your desired animal characters to play. The controls and keys required to play the game are very simple because all you would have to do is move.</p>
              <br>
              <p class = "info">The controls are either WASD or the arrow keys to move, and esc to exit. </p>
              <div class = "middle">
                <img src="./images/wasd.png" alt="wasd" height="300px" width="300px"/>
              <img src="./images/arrow.png" alt="arrows" height="300px" width="300px"/>
              <img src="./images/esc.png" alt="esc" height="300px" width="300px"/></div>
              <br>
              <p class = "info">To attack, the attacking/shooting function is automatic.</p>
              <div class = "middle"> <img src = "./images/shooting.gif" alt = "shooting" height = "400px" width = "600px"> </div>
              <br>
              <p class = "info"> In the stage, there will be your characters health bar. You will have to dodge enemies to avoid damage and each time you take damage by enemy attacks the health bar will deplete. And obviously when your health is depleted, you lose and reset the stage.</p>
              <div class = "middle"> <img src = "./images/health.gif" alt = "health" height = "350px" width = "550px">
            <img src = "./images/gameover.gif" alt = "gameover" height = "350px" width = "600px"> </div>
            <br>
            <p class = "info"> There will be a score count and the score will depend on the number of enemies defeated during the stage.
At the end of the stage there will be a boss battle with special abilities, making it hard and tricky to counter. Until the boss is defeated is when the stage will be cleared.
<br><br>
An animated example of what the game design, objective, actions, and functions would look like is shown below:</p>
<div class = "middle"> <img src = "./images/gameexample.gif" alt = "gameexample" height = "450px" width = "900px"></div>
<div class = "source"><a href = "https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/realm/building-space-shooter-game-syncs-unity-mongodb-realm/)"> Source to the content</a></div>
<p class = "info"> As you can see by the example, you will need to put your cognitive skills to use. In the beginning, it is easy to manoeuvre around however, as you progress throughout the stage you must adapt to the quicken pace whilst having fairly quick reaction time to dodge enemies. It only gets harder and faster, making it difficult for your cognitive abilities to keep up. </p>
<br>
<h4 class = "questions"> Tools and technologies </h4>
<p class = "info"> The game will be developed using game developing software’s such as Unity, Construct 2 or Cocos2d because each software has their unique system to develop games. To run these programs, a windows 10 laptop or PC is required, due to the software’s not being compatible with systems such as Mac.</p>
<div class = "middle">
  <img src = "./images/unity.png" alt = "unity" height = "300px" width = "400px">
<img src = "./images/2d.png" alt = "2d" height = "300px" width = "250px">
<img src = "./images/construct.png" alt = "construct" height = "300px" width = "300px"> </div>
<br>
<p class = "info">As for the designs of the sprites and sheet templates for our characters, background and animations, websites like <a href = "https://graphicriver.net "> graphicriver </a> allows us to search around and download premade creation kits for the designs of the game.</p>
<div class = "middle"> <img src = "./images/river.PNG" alt = "river" height = "600px" width = "400px"></div>
<div class = "source"><a href = " https://graphicriver.net/item/space-shooter-creation-kit/4896403?ref=pxcr)"> Source to the content</a></div>
<br>
<p class = "info">For the audio, it’ll be quite hard to choose the correct sound effects to implement into the game but searching around sites like YouTube or <a href = "https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/game/ "> Mixkit</a> can help.</p>
<br>
<h4 class = "questions"> Skills Required </h4>
<p class = "info"> According to: <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2014/august/unity-developing-your-first-game-with-unity-and-csharp"> Unity</a>
  Developing a game in Unity is a fairly straightforward process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><pre class = "list">Bring in your assets (audio, artwork etc)</pre></li>
    <li><pre class = "list">Write code to implement such as JavaScript etc</pre></li>
    <li><pre class = "list">Test in Unity</pre></li>
    <li><pre class = "list">Test on platform</pre></li>
  </ol>
<br>
<p class = "info"> For the project to develop, it is important to understand how the game developing software works and the codes that are needed to be implemented. Learning those two skills first are the most crucial and important part into developing a game. However, I don’t think its feasible as there are a lot of steps involved and not time and experience.</p>
<ol>
  <li><pre class = "list">Watching/learning tutorials on how to develop a functioning game with codes, assets and software is very time consuming</pre></li>
  <li><pre class = "list">It will be difficult to acquire the necessary skills (learning certain programming language etc)</pre></li>
  <li><pre class = "list">There are certain software’s/programs/assets where you will have to pay for</pre></li>
</ol>

<h4 class = "questions"> Outcome </h4>
<p class = "info"> My goal for others when choosing to develop a game as a project is to satisfy others with entertainment. Not only is the purpose of a game being to entertain others, it can also help develop certain skills. It is proven that games are beneficial for you as it can:</p>
<ol>
  <li><pre class = "list">Improve manual dexterity</pre></li>
  <li><pre class = "list">Increase problem solving skills and logic</pre></li>
  <li><pre class = "list">Improve cognitive skills</pre></li>
  <li><pre class = "list">Greater multi-tasking abilities</pre></li>
  <li><pre class = "list">Faster and more accurate decision making</pre></li>
  <li><pre class = "list">Better attention to detail</pre></li>
  <li><pre class = "list">And many more!!</pre></li>
</ol>
<p class = "info"> As for myself, I believe it will greatly increase my skills and knowledge for IT for game developing and open my eyes to a potential new career/goal path for the future. Regardless, it will allow me to gain the experience I need for my future ideal job.</p>
