<p class = "info">Hi! My name is Daniel La, I’m 19 years old and my date of birth is the 22nd of January 2003. My nationality is Vietnamese and Chinese, as my mum being full Vietnamese and dad being half Vietnamese and half Chinese. Growing up, both my parents taught me their national language, so I am able to fundamentally speak and understand a few languages such as Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese and Hakka. For my family, we would celebrate many Asian and globally common cultural celebrations such as Christmas, New year’s, Lunar new year, Mid-autumn festival etc, where we traditionally have family parties, delicious mooncakes, presents and red pockets. For my education, I was a high school graduate of 2020 from Wellington Secondary College who studied English, Chinese, Maths Methods, Accounting, Economics and Psychology. I previously enrolled and studied Bachelor of Computer Science last year, however the course layout and content were not to my interest, thus now I am studying IT. During my free time, I have hobbies of listen to music, watching videos, play many games like Valorant, exercising and attend social gatherings. A few interesting facts about me is that my favourite artist is Khalid, I love watching videos such as YouTube, movies, Netflix, anime etc and my favourite food is Pho, a popular traditional Vietnamese dish.
