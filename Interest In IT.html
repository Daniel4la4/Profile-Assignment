      <h4 class = "questions">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </h4>
      <p class = "info">When technology started to quickly progress, electronics such as Ds, Consoles, phones etc caught my interest due to my family members (cousins and uncles) introducing me to the world of IT. I was very fascinated by the advance technology rising, especially how phones, computers and the internet functioned. Since then, playing video games, watching videos, listening to music, and exploring the internet became a hobby till this day. It amazes me how much technology has changed over the last decade and how it continues to improve and change the future, which is something I want to be a part of.</p>

      <h4 class = "questions">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
      <p class = "info"> I chose to enrol into RMIT because compared to any other universities, RMIT is very diverse with their courses which gave me a lot of opportunity to select from and explore my interest. Not only does RMIT have flexible timetables for all students, but also the teachings and the environment are great. The learning environment on campus are nice and relaxing to study in, as well as teachers committing well on their teachings by assisting struggling students</p>

      <p class = "info"> Over the years, as I continue to study IT, I need to be able to discover what I would want to truly become in the future and whether my current goals are the same.

Being able to use my IT knowledge in practical and theoretical scenarios shows how much I truly learnt during my studies.</p>
