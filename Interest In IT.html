      <h4 class = "questions">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </h4>
      <p class = "info">When technology started to quickly progress, electronics such as Ds, Consoles, phones etc caught my interest due to my family members (cousins and uncles) introducing me to the world of IT. I was very fascinated by the advance technology rising, especially how phones, computers and the internet functioned. Since then, playing video games, watching videos, listening to music, and exploring the internet became a hobby till this day. It amazes me how much technology has changed over the last decade and how it continues to improve and change the future, which is something I want to be a part of.</p>
